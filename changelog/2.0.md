# Version 2.0

- This is a **complete rewrite**.
- Paramorphism is now out of the beta phase. Pricing will remain at $80 for now.
- A new site for Paramorphism now exists at [paramorphism.dev](https://paramorphism.dev/)

## Breaking Changes

- Flags no longer exist. `corruption` and `anti_decompression` are now individual strategies (which are disabled by default), and the Kotlin strategies are now always enabled (unless explicitly disabled).
- `maven_libraries` no longer exists in Paramorphism 2.0, but a reworked design will come in a future version with support for maven over HTTP(S).

## Enhancements

- **New:** The *String Concealing* and *Method Indirection* strategies now use a new, `invokedynamic`-based technique to conceal the original values.
- **New:** A new, experimental strategy called *Force No Verify* has been introduced. This lets us disable the bytecode verifier to force the JVM to accept classes which can cause crashes in every decompiler and most reversing tools.
- **New:** Paramorphism now has a public API, as well as support for custom transforming strategies. The plan is for this to develop into proper plugin support. Documentation coming soon.
