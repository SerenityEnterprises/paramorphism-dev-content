# Version 2.0

- This is a **complete rewrite**.
- Paramorphism is now out of the beta phase. Pricing will remain at 
- A new site for Paramorphism now exists at [paramorphism.dev](https://paramorphism.dev/)

## Breaking Changes

- Flags no longer exist. `corruption` and `anti_decompression` are now individual strategies (disabled by default), and the Kotlin strategies are now always enabled (unless explicitly disabled).

## Enhancements

- **New:** Dynamic Dispatch strategy, which replaces many types of method invocations with `invokedynamic`.
- String and method indirection strategies now use a new technique to conceal the original values
