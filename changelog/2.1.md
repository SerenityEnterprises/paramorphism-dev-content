# Version 2.1

Small release fixing some big issues with the obfuscator. Expect real features to come in the next updates.

- The packing strategy can now be configured via the config file
- `method_indirection` is now fixed for Java versions newer than 8.
- An update checker has been re-added to the project.
- Crashes on certain systems with `force_no_verify` have been fixed.

## Known issues

- It has been discovered that the string obfuscation isn't entirely thread safe. Expect a fix to come in 2.2 soon.
